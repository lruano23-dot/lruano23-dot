Hello! My name is Lisette Ruano.
I am an undergraduate CS student at UIC currently
interested in machine learning. 

This previous summer I've interned with Argonne National Labratory working on automating the process
of diamond etching to produce quantum bits. This is where my interest in machine learning started and since
I've been open to more oppurtunities to work with machine learning.
